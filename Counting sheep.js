//Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

function countSheeps(arrayOfSheeps) {
    return arrayOfSheeps.filter(Boolean).length;
  }

  The code you provided is a JavaScript function that takes an array of values as its parameter and returns the number of truthy values in the array. In particular, it counts the number of "sheep" in the array.

// Here is how the function works:

// The function takes one parameter, arrayOfSheeps, which is an array of values.
// The filter method is called on arrayOfSheeps. The filter method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
// The provided function is Boolean, which is a built-in function in JavaScript that converts a value to a Boolean. In this case, it will return true for any truthy value, and false for any falsy value.
// Therefore, arrayOfSheeps.filter(Boolean) will create a new array with only the truthy values from the original array, which in this case are the "sheep".
// Finally, the length property is called on this new array, which returns the number of elements in the array.
// So the function countSheeps counts the number of "sheep" in the input array by filtering out any falsy values and returning the number of remaining truthy values.
